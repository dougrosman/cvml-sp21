This is a long video (a little over an hour!) But I've included chapter markers to make it easy to jump to just the sections you need. If you are familiar with Google Colab (and particularly the StyleGAN2-ada-PyTorch notebook we've been using in this class, then there are definitely parts of this video you can skip)
