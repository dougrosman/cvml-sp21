# Machine Learning Artworks and Experiments Deconstructed

### How were these images created?

Write out how you *think* this was all done before doing research. Once you've thought through the process, answer the following questions, then do some research to see if you can find documentation that explains the process.

Answer these questions:
1. Describe what the images in the data set were used.
2. How were the images in the data set gathered/created?
3. What neural networks may have been used to create the data set?
4. What neural network was likely used in the final step to create the final output? This might not be readily apparent just by looking at the finished work, but take a guess!
5. How did they achieve the final output? Is it just the raw output of the neural network as images/video? Or is the output of the network situated in a certain context? Or maybe the neural networks elements are only an aspect of the final output.
