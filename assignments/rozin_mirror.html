  <p><strong>Due: Tuesday, Feb 16 in class</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: this isn't graded, and submitting this assignment is not required in order to pass this class. But completing this is highly recommended!</em><em></em></p>
<h3><strong>Prompt</strong></h3>
<p>Create your own "Rozin Mirror" based on the work of <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="https://www.smoothware.com/danny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Rozin</a>, specifically his 'Software Mirrors' (although of course, the software mirror <em>you </em>create can be inspired by his physical installations). Basically, finish what we started in class on Tuesday, Feb 9.</p>
<p>If we were to reduce the Rozin Mirror project to a single prompt, it might be: <strong>Create your own "filter" that abstracts, distorts, or somehow manipulates </strong><strong>a live webcam feed, and mirrors it back to the participant. This filter does not need to be "intelligent", it only has to translate/transform raw color information received from the webcam into some other aesthetic.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Guidelines</strong></h3>
<p>I feel that the expectations of this assignment were made clear in class as we worked on these. But just to be specific...</p>
<ol>
<li>Using p5.js, create a sketch that uses raw color information from a webcam feed to draw something to the p5.js canvas (for example, draw a square for every 20th pixel that changes size depending on how bright a pixel is). Feel free to draw on any experience you might have with p5.js.</li>
<li>Move your code out of the p5.js web editor and into an actual web page! We covered this at the end of class on Tuesday (lecture 02, part 4), but I will be posting a standalone video showing this process, as this is something we'll be doing throughout the semester.</li>
</ol>
<p>In class on Tuesday, we will be sharing our mirrors with each other. Since we aren't meeting in person, this show-and-tell will have us sharing our links with each other, and experiencing each others' work on our own computers.</p>
<h3><strong>How to submit (again, this isn't required to pass the class)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Upload the URL to your GitHub Pages web page with your Rozin Mirror to this Canvas assignment</strong> (this is so you can familiarize yourself with how to share your work! But also so that I have a link to your repository for future reference :) ) (as mentioned above, I'll be posting a video showing how to do this, but it will basically be a condensed version of the lecture 2, part 4 video).</p>
<h3><strong>Additional Stuff (some readings!)</strong></h3>
<p>I forgot to mention this in class, but please read <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="http://www.flong.com/archive/texts/essays/essay_cvad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this article by Golan Levin:&nbsp;</a><a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="http://www.flong.com/archive/texts/essays/essay_cvad/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Computer Vision for Artists and Designers: Pedagogic Tools and Techniques for Novice Programmers</em></a>.&nbsp;<strong>(it's a 10-15 minute read)</strong> It's from 2006, and a nice snapshot of the interactive art/computer vision landscape of the time.</p>
<p>Also, read/view <a class="instructure_file_link inline_disabled" href="http://www.flong.com/archive/texts/essays/essay_pose/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this visual essay (also by Golan Levin): Hands Up! A Visual Essay on the 'Media Art Pose'</a>&nbsp;<strong>(a 2-4 minute read)</strong></p>
