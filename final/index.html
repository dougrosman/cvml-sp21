      <h2>Intro to Computer Vision:<br>Spring 2021 Final Projects</h2>
      <h3>Instructor: Doug Rosman | TA: Blake Fall-Conroy</h3>
      <p><em>Intro to Computer Vision</em> in SAIC's Art and Technology Studies department is a technically rigorous studio course that introduces students to 'computer vision': an interdisciplinary field of study concerned with creating hardware and software that allow computers to see and "understand" the world around them. For as long as artists have incorporated computers into their practices, they have utilized computer vision technologies, whether that's through interactive installations that react to bodies captured through cameras, or more recently, in experiments with 'Artificial Intelligence' using machine learning and deep neural networks.</p>
      <p>This course teaches both "traditional" computer vision and more contemporary machine-learning-based approaches. The semester began with learning how to use code to manipulate images and video at the pixel level to make interactive are using webcams and Color+Depth sensors like the Microsoft Kinect. Then, the course pivotted to working with deep learning and Generative Adversarial Networks, where the technical focus shifts from code writing towards the meticuluous assembly of data sets.</p>
     </p>
     <p>While this course embraces the creative possibilities afforded by these tools, it also critically engages with the realities of working with technologies that surveil, control, and further entrench the harmful biases embedded in our culture. Neural networks "learn" to synthesize images by 'training' on a data set of often thousands of images. As artists working with these technologies, our critical entry point typically begins with the composition of our data sets. Where did this data come from? What does it mean for me to use it? What sorts of biases exist in these data sets, and are those biases problematic?</p>

     <p>In this collection of final projects, these artists have all experimented with the generative possibilities of deep neural networks. Some have used these tools to look outward, using images scraped from external sources to reimagine the world around them. Others looked inward, using these tools to create deeply personal works that examine how these technologies shape the fabric of who we are. Although these works are presented as "final projects", many are still considered to be in progress.</p>
