# CVML Final Project

For the final project, create a work, or a series of works, that draws from the tools and concepts in this class. As you create with the materials from this class, consider them as both tools for image making, as well as subject matter in themselves. 

Considering how new we are to some of these tools, use this opportunity to experiment. It's okay if you don't feel like your work is "done", work in progress is fine for this final. Whether or not the work is done, you should still put it in the time to make it presentable for the final (guidelines on that below).

In the last week of class, we will present our works to each other. Given some of the constraints of class critiques over Zoom, I would like our "in-person" presentations to be more like a glorified show-and-tell + discussion. In addition to that, I would like to include an asynchronous critique, where we will respond to each other's work in more depth either through writing or audio recording.

## Part 1: The work
Your project can exist in whatever form makes sense for the work, but for this class, we will be creating a website to show all of your work, so make sure that your work can be presented on a web page.

### Presentation options for the work:
1. Images on a web page
2. Image/Video Documentation of a physical installation
3. Videos on a web page (e.g. latent space walks)
4. p5.js sketch (interactive or non-interactive)
5. Hosting your trained model in runway and displaying output dynamically on a web page using p5.js
6. Realtime performance (although at minimum you should have some documentation that can live on a web page)

## Part 2: Writing
### 2a: Title/medium/Date/Name
You know, the usual stuff for a project.
1. Work Title
2. Preferred Name
3. Year the work was produced
4. Medium/materials (this is a bit different than the "technical details" below, although there will likely be some overlap. We will discuss how to list medium/materials in the coming weeks).
5. Social Media/Website: Include your website URL and social media handles, or however you want people to find your other work.
6. Link to the NFT of the work (LOL JK (unless...?))
7. The above was a joke. Whether or not you make an NFT of your work is up to you, but at present, I would request that you don't include any potential NFT information as part of this. This is worth a discussion, I think.

### 2b: Project Statement
In addition to the work, please write a 3-4 sentence project statement that contextualizes your work for your audience.

For your project statement, take some time to read how artists working with computer vision and AI think about (and write about) their work. Here's a good place to start:

[**aiartists.org - Founding Members**](https://aiartists.org/ai-artist-founding-members) â€“ click on 'View Artist Profile' for any of these artists, and scroll down on their page to their written responses to interviews. You can also look up their website portfolios to find more project statements. Looking on YouTube for interviews with the artists can also be useful.

### 2c: Technical Details
Use this space to reveal the tools and processes behind the work. This should be a short section that explains just enough to make it clear what the work is doing. If you'd like to write a long-form explanation of your process, I recommend doing that in a separate section. Things to address here:
1. (optional, but highly encouraged) How many images are in your data set?
2. (required) Where did the images in your data set come from/how did you retrieve them?
3. (required) What Machine Learning model(s) did you use? (e.g. StyleGAN2-ADA, pix2pixHD, GPT-2, etc.)
4. (optional) How long did you it take to train your model, and what graphics cards were used?
5. (optional) Where did you train your model? (e.g. Google Colab, your own computer, etc.)
6. (optional) What technique did you use to create your work (e.g. latent space interpolation)

### 2d: Credit
We can't possibly credit all of the people and institutions that have contributed to these projects, but there are a few things you should do.
1. **Credit the creators of the model you're using**. You can usually find information about this in the GitHub repo for your model (e.g. for StyleGAN2-ADA-Pytorch and other Nvidia repos, you can find citation information at the bottom of the Repo in the 'Licenses' Section)
2. **Credit anyone involved in the creation of your dataset.** If you scraped your data from somewhere, list the source. If you pulled the frames from a video you found online, credit the creator of that video. If you used certain people, or things created by certain people as subject matter for your data set, credit those folks.
3. **Credit/thank creators of tools** that you feel significantly aided in your creation of your work (for example, I wouldn't credit 'Google Colab', but I might credit Derrick Schultz for the creation of the StyleGAN2-ADA-PyTorch repo/notebook we've been using)
