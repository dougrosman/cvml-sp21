# CVML Final Project

For the final project, create a work, or a series of works, that draws from the tools and concepts in this class.

## Part 1: The work
Your project can exist in whatever form makes sense for the work, but for this class, we will be creating a website to show all of your work, so make sure that your work can be presented on a web page.

## Part 2: Project statement
In addition to the work, please also write a 3-4 sentence project statement that contextualizes your work for your audience.

For your project statement, take some time to read how artists working with computer vision and AI think about their work. Here's a good place to start:
1. [aiartists.org - Founding Members](https://aiartists.org/ai-artist-founding-members) â€“ click on 'View Artist Profile' for any of these artists, and scroll down on their page to their written responses to interviews.
